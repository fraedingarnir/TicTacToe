##Introduction
>The programming part of the assignment was to implement the classic game, TicTacToe with Agile software development methods. In the beginning the group members started programming with no vision nor notion of how it was supposed to be implemented. It caused a kind of chaos and the group members saw quickly that it wasn't worth it and decided to bring our ideas of implementation together.
	The group members then started talking and deciding exactly how it was supposed to be implemented and made a class diagram showing our ideas.

##Design of the program
>We decided to split the program into parts so testing would be easier. The implementation that was decided on split the code into three classes: Controller, Player and Board. The idea was that the Controller would take care of running the game, Player would manage the players and the Board would control all the visuals of the game.

>These classes and it's construction can be seen below.
